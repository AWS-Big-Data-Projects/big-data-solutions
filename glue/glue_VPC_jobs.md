In the case where Glue needs to access data stores in a VPC, a VPC endpoint is required for S3. Glue sets up elastic network interfaces to enable jobs to connect securely to resources within a VPC, where each elastic network interface is assigned a private IP address from the IP address range within the relevant subnet. Use of an S3 VPC endpoint allows Glue to use private IP addresses to access Amazon S3, meaning that traffic between the VPC and S3 stays private and does not leave the Amazon network (i.e. it does not use the public internet).

Thirdly, and again in the case where Glue needs to access data stores in a VPC, a self-referencing rule is required in the security group assigned to each data store (e.g. Amazon Redshift or RDS). This rule needs to allow access over all TCP ports (inbound and outbound) with the security group itself as a source. This allows for traffic between Glue components and the data store in the VPC.
