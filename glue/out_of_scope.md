First of all I would like to clarify the scope of AWS Premium Support - while we can certainly help you in Glue or Spark-related issues, we do not provide support for custom and/or third-party libraries that do not come bundled with the service. I wanted to stress this because we are not familiar with the "<>" library and from what I can gather in our internal AWS wikis this seems to be an internal package. Again, we are not familiar enough with it to provide any solid recommendations on its troubleshooting.
