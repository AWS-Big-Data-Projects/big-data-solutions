Tez is faster because:

Execute Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) as a single job in the MapReduce engine. The DAG requires each set of mappers to be followed by one set of reducers. This requirement causes multiple MapReduce jobs to be spun off for each Hive query. Tez doesn't have such constraint and can process complex DAG as one job minimizing job startup overhead. Avoids unnecessary writes. Multiple jobs are used to process the same Hive query in the MapReduce engine. The output of each MapReduce job is written to HDFS for intermediate data. Since Tez minimizes number of jobs for each Hive query, it's able to avoid unnecessary writes. Minimizes start-up delays. Tez is better able to minimize start-up delay by reducing the number of mappers it needs to start and also improving optimization throughout. Reuses containers. Whenever possible Tez will reuse containers to ensure that latency from starting up containers is reduced. Continuous optimization techniques. Traditionally optimization was done during compilation phase. However more information about the inputs is available that allow for better optimization during runtime. Tez uses continuous optimization techniques that allow it to optimize the plan further into the runtime phase.
